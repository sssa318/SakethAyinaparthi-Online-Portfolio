                        Hi! My name is Saketh and I am a junior at Dublin High School. Scroll down to learn more about me..
                    </div>
                    <!-- Intro -->
                    <p class="lead mar"><b>“Never say never, because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.” - Michael Jordan</b></p>
                    <p class="lead mar">My name is Saketh Ayinaparthi and I am a 17-year-old junior at Dublin High School. In the future, I hope to get accepted into a good university and pursue my undergraduate degree. Afterward, I would like to get a good job, and be able to have a great life and support my family.</p>
                    <!-- Goals -->
                    <p class="lead mar">Ever since middle school, the sciences have always fascinated me. I enjoy many specializations within the field, whether it be chemistry, biology, or physics. Science is largely defined by the repeated cycles of thought and analysis, which always can be improved upon. On top of this, the fact that the sciences may also provide solutions for some of the most relevant problems in today’s world motivates me to learn more. Some areas in the science field that I am leaning towards are medicine (specifically a physician) and bioengineering. To be able to go down these paths, I will be required to either go into the medicine track or get a bachelor's degree in bioengineering. If I want to get into the bioengineering field, I also hope to get an MBA and to help me understand the business side of the field and maybe join the management in a big pharmaceutical company.</p>
                    <!-- Achievements in school and outside school -->
                    <p class="lead mar">To be able to accomplish my future aspirations, I have pushed myself to undertake different challenges. The rigorous classes that I have taken and am currently taking at my high school play a large role in preparing me for my future ambitions. Another experience outside of school that will help me in my future endeavors is the years of high-level cricket that I played. I started playing cricket nationally in 2014, and it has helped me learn to deliver under immense pressure.  My performances in some tournaments also allowed me to lead the team in the 2018 U14 tournament, which has allowed me to learn to lead a team under pressure and at the same time, put out my best performance. My experiences in leading my team and being under pressure have taught me to be calm under pressure and lead my team, and simultaneously perform at a high level. On top of this, my work experiences teaching young kids has taught me to be confident in the things that I do, and be energetic and serious at the same time.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">These experiences, along with others, have allowed me to develop into the person that I am today. Throughout high school, I have learned that no matter how difficult something maybe, if I work hard enough, I will be able to accomplish it. High school has helped me realize the importance of hard work and perseverance, but at the same time, I must be able to have a balance in my life. To maintain this balance, I have to take responsibility and make sure to push myself to do my best, and also enjoy my life to the fullest.</p>

                    <p>When I'm not in school, I enjoy being in the outdoors. I love playing many sports, which includes my two favorite, cricket and martial arts. I have been playing cricket for almost 12 years, and I have played the sports nationally for 6 years in a row, and one international tournament. In martial arts, I am a 3rd degree black belt, and I love both learning and teaching the sport. Along with the sports, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and biking around the area.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I watch a number of shows, including my favorites like NCIS and Avatar: The Last Airbender, I  aspire to be a good cook and make great food for other people, and I spend large amounts of my free time playing video games, working out, or watching the stock market.</p>
